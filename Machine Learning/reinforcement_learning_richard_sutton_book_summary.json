      "topic": "Introduction to Reinforcement Learning",
      "description": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.",
      "child_explanation": "Imagine you’re playing a video game. You try different moves to get points, and if you do something wrong, you lose points. RL is like teaching a robot to play the game by learning from its mistakes and rewards!",

      "topic": "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)",
      "description": "MDPs are mathematical frameworks used to model decision-making in environments where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of the agent.",
      "child_explanation": "Think of MDPs like a board game where you roll a dice to move. You decide where to go, but the dice adds some randomness. The goal is to find the best path to win!",

      "description": "Policy gradient methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that optimize the policy directly by adjusting its parameters to maximize rewards.",
      "child_explanation": "Imagine you’re teaching a dog tricks. Instead of telling it exactly what to do, you reward it when it does something close to what you want. Policy gradients work the same way, helping the robot learn the best actions!",
