      "description": "Backpropagation is a method used in artificial neural networks to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights in the network.",
      "child_explanation": "Think of backpropagation like practicing a sport. When you make a mistake, your coach tells you how to fix it. Backpropagation helps the robot brain learn from its mistakes and get better!",
